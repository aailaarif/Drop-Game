(Fall 2022) This is the [Drop Sprite demo](https://cssegit.monmouth.edu/jchung/drop-sprite-demo), modified as starter code for Project 1.

The most notable change is the addition of the DropSprite class which extends the Sprite class to create individual raindrop sprites. Also, the bucket is also a Sprite so that it can change color (tint).
